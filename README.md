# BallPong
A ball pong game created in java/processing. Still a work in progress.




Problems: 

1. Top paddle is the second paddle and is supposed to be an AI paddle to play against but AI doesn't seem to follow the ball. Need help with the AI development for top paddle. 

2. Hit counters for both players can't run simultaneously together for some reason. 

3. Levels: I would like there to be a number gage labled 1-5 that allows player to make the game harder or easier, I do have a poor way of doing this by controlling frame rate but would love to learn how to fix the level system properly. 

4. Need more ideas on how to make it more fun.
